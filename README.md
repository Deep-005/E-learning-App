Effortless Enrollment: Browse through diverse courses and enroll with a single tap.
Secure Payments: Enroll in premium courses easily using the integrated payment gateway.
Certifications: Earn a certification to showcase your expertise after completing a course.
Real-Time Data Management: Powered by Firebase, the app ensures secure and efficient storage and retrieval of user data.
User-Friendly Design: A clean and intuitive interface that makes navigation a breeze.

**Technologies Used**
Frontend: Java/Kotlin for Android development.
Backend: Firebase for real-time database management.
Payment Gateway: Integrated for seamless and secure transactions.
Design: Material Design principles for a smooth user experience.
